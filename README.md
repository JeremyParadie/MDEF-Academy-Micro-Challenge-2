<h3> Project Description: </h3>
<h5> “Dead Ideas/Things” </h5>
During term2 of our MDEF program, each of us has experienced a range of emotions within our design process. At times we have felt hope and excitement and at times frustration and failure. Within this journey, many ideas and things have been created and many have been laid to death.

We want to open up the “black box” of our design processes, and gather these moments which we consider failures and mistakes. By collecting the “dead” artifacts, the ones that did not make it alive, from individual processes, we hope to explore the connections between these objects and generate new narratives. Through these new narratives, we aim to open up an alternative understanding of failure within the design process and expose the power of the collective.

In the coming design dialogues, we aim to investigate death, failure, and vulnerability within the design process and how these individual moments can collectively be brought to life to create new and collective emergent narratives.

As designers, we usually present only the final outcomes of our designs to the public, while the process tends to stay hidden in the “black box”.

In a way, we want to think about what can emerge from the connections of our collective “dead” ideas?

<h3> Brainstorming:</h3>
Link to our miro board: (https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOErRQPQ=/)
<p>We used the Venn Diagram format to fill out our personal interests and then added our intersecting interests between the group. It was interesting to see how the other team members describe the common theme in relation to their personal interests. The recurring theme within the group were collective biographies, new narratives and culture.</p>

<p>It was a bit challenging at think of concepts which could be made tangible with the abstract keywords we chose to work with. We had to find a middle ground between defamiliarising the object but the stories relatable for everyone too.</p>

<p>To start off with, we asked our classmates to get one object that is (or was) significant for their design process, it could be whatever: a tool, a drawing, a prototype, a failure or anything else.</p>

<h3>Plan and Execution of the Project: </h3>
<p>Before going into the form and technical details, we wanted the idea to be clear and to make sure all of us are on the same page, we decided to keep the first day (Monday) to think about what kind of possibilities could emerge with these "dead" objects. </p>

<p>While discussing our idea with Kate, we realised to "display" our idea it was quite important to keep two things in mind: the interaction of the people with objects (how would they hold it intuitively and not to interfere with their movements) and to keep the presentation of the objects and the speaker appealing.</p>

<p>Images of different forms for the base (horizontal circle, vertical display, objects in a black box, octopus)</p>

<p>Various ways of making the object conductive </p>

<p>The concept of generating a haiku (segments of each sentence told by the person who contributed the object) by touching each object </p>
